{"tagline":"","name":"Lifebucket","body":"### What's all this, then?\r\n\r\nLifebucket is webapp that uses CouchDB as a backend to help you quantify your life.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n* Haven't even started on the output. Not sure how I'm going to implement that, yet.\r\n* Lifebucket is still under heavy development, the external API **will** be changing. That said, the only thing that Lifebucket cares about in the data, the timestamp, won't change (from UNIX epoch time). End result is: if you intend to only use the web frontend for now, it's perfectly usable (for input).\r\n* I haven't bothered doing a real deployment yet, I can't help with that.\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n\r\n    % git clone https://github.com/hdonnay/lifebucket.git\r\n    % cd lifebucket\r\n    % cpanm Dancer YAML Dancer::Template::Tenjin AnyEvent::CouchDB Dancer::Plugin::Auth::Basic\r\n    % COUCH_URL=\"https://user:pass@my.iriscouch.com:6894\" ./bin/app.pl","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
